# eday
e-day stands for e-commerse day, build for e-commerse web

# version
this is version 2.0.0

you might wanna use the stable one in
[https://github.com/9r3i/eday/tree/1.2.1-stable](https://github.com/9r3i/eday/tree/1.2.1-stable)

# requirements
this version has been using namespace \eday, so it's very different from the old one

this version also requires another library, but fortunately, I put everything on it.

still, i suggest use the old one because that version is stable.
